# HPC User Support Kit
Purpose: evidence that I can onboard and support users on an HPC/AI platform — SLURM job lifecycle, environment troubleshooting, documentation, and intake/records management.

## Context
Self-directed project built over ~30 focused hours as preparation for an HPC user-support role. I have no prior professional HPC or Linux experience.
I used AI throughout as a teaching mentor.
Where I wrote content myself, it reflects my aspiration for foundational understanding, not expertise.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SLURM job submission (`sbatch`, `squeue`, `sacct`) | Executed (dockerized sandbox) | `evidence/terminal_transcripts/slurm_demo.txt`     |
| CPU demo workload (sklearn logistic regression)    | Executed                      | job output under `demos/cpu_demo/`                 |
