# T5: container can't see files

## User message

> I'm running my pipeline inside an Apptainer container on the cluster. The container starts fine, but when my script tries to read `/project/labdata/input.csv` it says `FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory`. The file definitely exists — I can see it outside the container. Job 8045
